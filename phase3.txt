2- This report should minimally summarize the business requirements and any additions you
may have made, the entity-relationship design, the (relational) logical database design, and
the application program design. For each of these, you should identify the major design
decisions you faced and the design decisions you made with justifications for those decisions.
The application program design should have at least three web pages to connect to the
database. You may choose any language and platform for your application program.
3- Normalize the Relations: The steps to follow for three relations are:
a) Write out the relation (schema) including all attribute names. Indicate keys and foreign
keys.
b) Provide some sample data for the relation (5 rows).
c) State the Key for the relation and write down Functional Dependencies.
d) State that this relation is in 3NF.
If a relation fails to meet the definition of a third normal form (e.g., it contains a partial-
key dependency or it contains a transitive dependency), then split the relation into new
relations.
Begin the normalization process from the beginning with each of these new relations.
4- Write four queries in English and answer in SQL code, show a screen dump or SNIP
that shows the SQL code and the result (You may use the same queries from Phase II).
Write four SQL Queries;
1 contains GROUP BY
1 contains GROUP BY and HAVING
1 contains nested query with ALL
1 contains nested query with IN
5- A narrative conclusion section that describes:
a) the group's experience with the project (which steps were the most difficult? Which were
the easiest? What did you learn that you did not imagine you would have? If you had to do it
all over again, what would you have done differently?)
b) any final comments and conclusions.
